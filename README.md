❤️ Comprehensive Machine Learning Pipeline on Heart Disease (UCI Dataset)
📌 General Description

This project aims to analyze, predict, and visualize heart disease risks using machine learning techniques. The workflow covers data preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction (PCA), supervised & unsupervised learning, model optimization, and deployment.

The pipeline leverages classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM) and clustering methods (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to extract insights and patterns from the data.

A Streamlit-based UI is developed for interactive predictions, deployed via Ngrok, and the full project is hosted on GitHub for open access.

🎯 Objectives

✅ Perform Data Preprocessing & Cleaning (missing values, encoding, scaling).

✅ Apply Dimensionality Reduction (PCA) to retain essential features.

✅ Implement Feature Selection using statistical methods (Chi-Square, RFE) and ML-based approaches.

✅ Train Supervised Learning Models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

✅ Apply Unsupervised Learning:

Hierarchical Clustering (Dendrogram)

✅ Optimize Models with Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV).

✅ Build a Streamlit UI for real-time user predictions. (Bonus)

✅ Deploy application with Ngrok (Bonus) and host on GitHub.
